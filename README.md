# Country_Profile_Data_Project

In this project, I analyzed country profile data from the MONDIAL Database. I used ElementTree and Pandas to process their XML dataset.

Source: http://www.dbis.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/Mondial/

I conducted five tasks on this dataset:
1) I found the top 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates.
2) I found the top 10 most populous cities.
3) I found the 10 largest ethnic groups in the world.
4) I found the name and country for the largest river and largest lake.
5) I found the top 10 airports with the highest elevation.

Other than this README, this project contains two other files:
1) "Country Profile Data Project.ipynb" - The analysis conducted in Jupyter. 
2) "mondial_database" - My dataset source
